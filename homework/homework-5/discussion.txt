After spending the time to endlessly debug the code one day after it has been counted as late, I have been unable make my implementation fully work.


There are multiple reasons for why this is happening. Currently my algorithms are properly running the steps to avoid any invalid memory accesses. 
However, the issues in my code lie in the fact that the image is being read with 3 8-bit channels. 8 Bits to represent an integer can only display values of up to 255.
As I am using the Mat data type from the opencv library, I am able to read the values and assign them correctly. However, ther are overflows occuring which lead to random numbers that appear in the image pixel value array.
This can be fixed by writing to an output array instead of the image pixel values themselves, however, this will take quite a bit of time to refactor.

I currently feel that it is better to cut my losses and submit the code that I have instead of trying to fix it and take a late penalty.
