# RMS Filter
This is an image filtering script for a grayscale image of a camera man.

the `rmsfilter.py` file is a self contained module that runs the code necessary for the homework assignment.

Future plans include making the script more organized by improving the CLI and adding more modularity in the main function.

# Edge Detection
This implementation uses the rms edge dection method.

CLI will try to be improved.
